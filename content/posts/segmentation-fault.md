- Segmentation fault or segfault is a type of error generated by programs.
- Segmentation fault happen when program tries to access the memory that doesn't belong to it.
- Segfault occurs in those programming languages where you can directly access and manipulate the memory.
# Example
1. Referencing a NULL pointer:

```c
int *p = NULL;
*p = 1;
```

2. When program tries to access read-only memory:

```c
char *str = "hello"; // constant strings are read only.
*str = "bao"; 
```

3. Dangling Pointer:

```c
char *p = NULL;
{
	char c;
	p = &c;
}
*p = 1; // Now p is dangling pointer as it cease to exist after upper block.
```

4. Accessing the address that doesn't exists in the memory.

Hi, I’m currently doing my undergrad in Computer Science. I’m into open source, Linux, DevOps, and vintage computing. I also love spending time automating things that probably don’t even need automation.

This is my personal website where I post blogs about what I’m learning and other computer-related topics. Any views shared here are my own and don’t represent the organizations I work with.
